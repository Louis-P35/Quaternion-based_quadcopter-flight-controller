/*
The Madgwick filter utilizes quaternion representations for calculating orientations. 
Quaternions are particularly well-suited for representing three-dimensional rotations because 
they do not suffer from gimbal lockâ€”a condition where the loss of one degree of freedom 
in three-dimensional space causes two of the three rotation axes to align, which can 
happen with Euler angles. Quaternions provide a compact, non-singular representation which 
ensures stable and continuous calculations even during full 360-degree rotations.
