/*
The Madgwick filter utilizes quaternion representations for calculating orientations.
Quaternions are particularly well-suited for representing three-dimensional rotations because
they do not suffer from gimbal lockâ€”a condition where the loss of one degree of freedom
in three-dimensional space causes two of the three rotation axes to align, which can
happen with Euler angles. Quaternions provide a compact, non-singular representation which
ensures stable and continuous calculations even during full 360-degree rotations.
